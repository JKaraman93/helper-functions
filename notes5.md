## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering
#### Dimensionality reduction
Once a dataset has been clustered, it is usually possible to measure each
instance’s affinity with each cluster: affinity is any measure of how well
an instance fits into a cluster. Each instance’s feature vector x can then
be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities.

### Anomaly detection

### Density estimation
