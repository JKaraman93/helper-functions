### Dropout
> [!TIP]
> It can also help to increase the dropout rate for large layers, and reduce it for small ones. It can also help to increase the dropout rate for its inputs.
>
> In practice, you can usually apply dropout only to the neurons in the top one to three layers (excluding the output layer).
